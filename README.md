# VChat - A Real-Time Chat Application

VChat is a real-time chat application that I have created using Next.js 13 and TailwindCSS. The application allows users to chat with each other in real-time, receive new messages, and differentiate between read and unread messages. Firebase is used as the backend for this project, which provides reliable and fast real-time data synchronization.
